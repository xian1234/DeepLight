This project is the codes and datasets of the manuscript entitled: 

DeepLight: Reconstructing high-resolution observations of artificial lights at night with multi-modality

We present a novel task of reconstructing high-resolution nighttime light images with multi-modality data



The codes and datasets are comming soon.



## Dataset Description

DeepLightMD is a natioanalscale multimodality SR dataset, consisting of training, validating, and testing material. The training material contains 18,032 pairs
of clips, the validating material contains 2,254 pairs of samples. To demonstrate evaluation at both local and regional scale, the testing material contains 2,254 pairs of clips and three provincelevel samples, covering Anhui, Beijing, and Taiwan. Each pair of clips contains LR NTL (256 × 256 in size), HR NTL (2048 × 2048 in
size), DMO (2048 × 2048 in size, 7 bands), DEM (2048 × 2048 in size), and ISP (2048 × 2048 in size).
